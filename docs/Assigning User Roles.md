# Assigning User Roles
A system administrator can control user privileges for your Web site.

To control user privileges for your site development and maintenance, Graffiti supports three predefined roles:

||User Role||Description||
|Admin|Has all user privileges, including Publishing content, Approving content, Adding categories, Managing users, Editing themes and widgets|
|Manager|Can publish content without approval as well as approve other usersâ€™ content.|
|Contributor|Can create new posts as well as edit existing posts. However, contributor content cannot be published to the public without first being approved by a manager or admin. When a contributor makes a change requiring approval, Graffiti notifies admins and managers via email.|

Only Admins have permission to assign user roles, so users with Manager and Contributor role assignments will not have access to People on the navigation bar.

_**Procedure**_

1. Navigate to Control Panel > People. The Manage People page displays.
