# Creating Navigation Links
Graffiti uses the Dynamic Navigation feature so you [can create links to categories and posts](Creating-Content-for-Your-Website).

By default, Graffiti creates navigation links for all of the top-level categories you create. However, you can also create links for all uncategorized posts as well as custom links to other pages in your site or to external sites.

_**Procedure**_

Because Graffiti initially creates links for your original categories, the following procedure shows how to create links for uncategorized posts and custom links.

## Posts
1. Navigate to Control Panel > Presentation > Navigation. The Navigation page displays.
