# Custom Fields
Graffiti's custom field functionality allows you to add custom fields to your Web site.

While Graffiti post feature supports the most common post-content needs, there will be times when you or a client requires additional field options to build your site.

You can think of custom fields as comprised of the following tasks:

* [Adding a custom field](Adding-a-custom-field)
* [Posting a custom field](Posting-a-custom-field)
* [Adding a custom field to a theme](Adding-a-custom-field-to-a-theme)
* [Deleting a custom field](Deleting-a-custom-field)
Custom fields are not visible until you edit the site theme to include the custom fields. It is simple for most Graffiti users to define custom field properties and post a custom field. However, adding the custom field to the theme requires you to have more advanced knowledge of Web site development and should probably be left to a developer.
