# About the Graffiti Database

Graffiti supports SQL Server, MySQL, or Microsoft Access, so you can use any of them as your database instead of VistaDB.

By default, Graffiti is configured to support a local SQL Server 2005/2008 connection. You should make the necessary changes to the web.config as necessary for your particular database provider. For more information, see [Configuring Database Providers](Configuring-Database-Providers).
