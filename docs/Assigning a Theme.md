Graffiti shows you the theme currently applied to your Web site (graffiticms in the example above). When you install the Graffiti package, Graffiti assigns the default theme to your Web site.

2. Click the theme you want to assign to your Web site. 

3. Refresh your Web site to see your web pages with the newly assigned theme.
