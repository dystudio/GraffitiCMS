# Creating an Uncategorized Post Widget

The Uncategorized Posts widget allows you to add any of your uncategorized posts to the sidebar. You can use [uncategorized posts](uncategorized-posts) as another way of managing content on your Web site. 

When you create an uncategorized post, you are not assigning it to any of your existing categories. Instead, you generally use it as a widget which you can add to your theme.
