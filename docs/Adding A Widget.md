Click here to learn more about widgets. Refer to Building a Widget for information about building a widget.

The following procedure shows how you can place a widget on a web page. The procedure will place the widget in the left sidebar, as shown below.

The theme shown above only supports a single sidebar in the leftcolumn; however, you can easily place them in the right column or even use both columns. It is up to the theme designer to make this decision.

_**Procedure**_

1. Navigate to Control Panel > Presentation > Widgets. The Manage Your Widgets page displays.

The page has 2 panels. The first contains a list of available widgets and a list of widgets which are selected but not yet added to a sidebar. A nice feature of this holding-pattern approach is that it gives you a convenient way to make any settings changes to a widget before placing it on your site. The right panel contains the left sidebar and right sidebar widget list.

2.To edit the widget, click Edit. A window opens with the editing options.

4.Drag the widgets from the holding area to the left sidebar column. The widget displays in the left column of your Web site.

_If you need to make a change later, you can remove, delete, or rearrange a widget, or even put it back in the holding area._
